# This is a rules file for the fiximports script.  Lines beginning
# with a '#' are ignored. Blank lines are also ignored.  Each entry is
# in the format:
#
# Account	Pattern	Debit min.	Debit max.	Credit min.	Credit max.
#
# *** Each column is separated with a tab (not spaces). ***

# - Account is a colon(:) separated account path.
# - Pattern is a valid Python regexp.
# - Debit/Credit min/max is a number that express a range where
#   the amount of the transaction is within. They are optional and to
#   ignore a column you should put a 0 in it.

# Rules shouldn't have overlapping ranges or otherwise your rules may
# not work as expected, i.e.: the incorrect rule is being applied to a
# transaction but you expected the rule that follows it to be applied
# instead. Format is a search pattern. Example:

# Expenses:Supplies	Random Store	2500

# Specifies that a transaction beginning with "Random Store" starting
# at 2500 and up should go into the "Expenses:Supplies"
# account. Account names now can have spaces in them.
